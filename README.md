# TransportCapacitySort
This is a solution to the second assigment on a programming interview
## Installation
For this to run you will need:
* Node.js (latest)
* At least 1 GB of unused ram if parsing large files
* before you can run it you need to do an `npm i` to install all needed libaries

Just clone the repo and your done with init.
## Usage
`node --expose-gc --max-old-space-size=2048 index.js <file path>`
the `--expose-gc` flag lets the programm controll the garbage collector and `--max-old-space-size=2048` flag sets increases heap memory size to 2GB
